1) We assume it will take about 10 minutes to read an article. 
and there are 60 different articles. which means it will take around 10 hours!.

2) We have learned Bash is a very efficient tool for some needs, and might be much more easier than writing the same program in c.
Another possible use for Bash:If someone's phone-log is given, we can easily find how many times he called a specific number.

3) We can write another script, that will run this script every hour.
To avoid scanning the same article twice, we can save their urls somewhere and check whether theyre new or not.
Also we can try to use the articke time mark- to check if it was published before or after the last scan.
